Description: Construct nomogram for a machine learning (ML) model to improve availability of an ML prediction model in addition to a computer application, particularly in a situation where a computer, a mobile phone, an internet connection, or the application accessibility are unreliable. This package enables a nomogram creation for any ML prediction models, which is conventionally limited to only a linear/logistic regression model. This nomogram may indicate the Shapley additive explanation value per feature for each individual. However, this package only allows a nomogram creation for a model using either 1+ categorical or 1 numerical predictors. Detailed methodologies and examples are documented in our vignette, available at <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/herdiantrisufriyana/rmlnomogram/blob/master/doc/ml_nomogram_exemplar.html>.
